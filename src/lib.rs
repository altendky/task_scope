//! A runtime extension for adding support for Structured Concurrency to existing runtimes.
//!
//! # What is Structured Concurrency?
//! [Structured Concurrency] is a programming paradigm that lets asynchronous operations run only
//! within certain scopes so that they form an operation stack like a regular function call stack.
//! As the parent operation waits until all children complete, Structured Concurrency helps local
//! reasoning of concurrent programs.
//!
//! # Out-of-task concurrency considered harmful
//! Most of the asynchronous programs are composed of `async` functions and *in-task* concurrency
//! primitives such as `select` and `join`, and this makes such futures automatically
//! well-structured. As "futures do nothing unless polled," executions of inner (child) operations
//! are very explicit (usually at the point of `await`s). Moreover, canceling a future is done by
//! dropping it, which will reclaim resources used for the operation, including the inner futures.
//! This drop-chain propagates the cancellation to the very end of the operation stack.
//!
//! *Out-of-task* concurrencies such as `spawn`, however, breaks the structure. They allow us to
//! start a new execution unit that can escape from the parent stack. Although frameworks provide a
//! way to join on the spawned task, they don't propagate cancellation properly. If you drop the
//! spawning task, the spawned task may outlive the parent indefinitely.
//!
//! `task_scope` is designed to offer a [`spawn`] function that properly respects cancellation.
//! [`scope`] function delimits a lifetime within which inner tasks are allowed to run. If you
//! issue a graceful cancellation or drop the scope, the runtime delivers a cancellation signal to all
//! the child tasks.
//!
//! # Cancellation points
//! `task_scope` requires the tasks to pass through cancellation points regularly to work effectively.
//! Consider the following (contrived) example:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use tokio::io::*;
//!
//! # async fn doc_loop() {
//! let mut read = repeat(42); // very fast input
//! let mut write = sink(); // very fast output
//!
//! copy(&mut read, &mut write).await.unwrap();
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! This program is virtually running into an infinite loop because `read` and `write` never
//! terminate. To make matters worse, this loop cannot be canceled from the outside because the
//! I/O operations always succeed, and `copy` function tries to continue as much as possible.
//! Therefore, the spawned task must cooperatively check for cancellation or yield the execution
//! regularly in a loop to preserve the well-structuredness.
//!
//! `task_scope` provides a convenience function [`cancelable`] to handle cancellation
//! automatically. It wraps the given `Future`/`AsyncRead`/`AsyncWrite` and checks for cancellation
//! (graceful or forced) before proceeding with the inner computation. The example above will look
//! like:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use futures::pin_mut;
//! use tokio::io::*;
//!
//! use task_scope::cancelable;
//!
//! # async fn doc_cancelable_loop() {
//! let read = cancelable(repeat(42)); // very fast, but cancelable input
//! pin_mut!(read); // needed for Unpin bound of copy
//! let mut write = sink(); // very fast output
//!
//! // this will terminate with an error on cancellation
//! copy(&mut read, &mut write).await.unwrap();
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! If the cancellation logic is more complex, you can poll [`Cancellation`] manually to check for
//! a cancellation signal.
//!
//! # Grace period and mercy period
//! `task_scope` supports two modes of cancellation. Graceful cancellation and forced cancellation.
//!
//! You can initiate a graceful cancellation by calling [`cancel`] method of the scope. This
//! notifies and gives a "grace period" to tasks in the scope so that they can start their
//! cancellation. The scope waits for all the tasks to complete as usual.
//!
//! A forced cancellation is propagated to tasks when the scope is dropped, or [`force_cancel`] is
//! called. Given that canceling a long-running is really hard as shown above, the canceled tasks
//! are given to a "mercy period." The tasks can continue their execution until they yield the
//! execution next time, and then the runtime will automatically cancel the task. The tasks should
//! shorten the mercy period as short as possible because it's technically breaking the program's
//! concurrency structure (a child is outliving the dropped parent).
//!
//! # `task_scope` is (almost) executor-agnostic
//! `task_scope` works by adding cancellation information to the current asynchronous context
//! provided by runtimes such as async-std and Tokio. Therefore, the propagation of cancellation
//! works regardless of executors. Even it's possible to propagate a cancellation of a task
//! running in a runtime to its child task running in another runtime.
//!
//! However, `task_scope` doesn't provide its own `spawn` API but delegates spawning to the executors.
//! Thus, to use `spawn`, you need to declare which runtime(s) you want to extend with
//! `task_scope` by enabling features of `task_scope`. For example, if you want to spawn a
//! cancelable task in a Tokio runtime, you need to enable `"tokio"` feature of `task_scope` and to
//! call [`task_scope::spawn::tokio::spawn`]. Currently, async-std and Tokio are supported.
//!
//! If only one runtime is enabled, [`task_scope::spawn`] refers to the `spawn` function for
//! the runtime. By default, only `"tokio"` feature is enabled.
